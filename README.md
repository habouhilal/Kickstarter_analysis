# Kickstarter_analysis

## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis on Excel for a dataset to determine what are the factors that make a fundraise successful.
### Purpose
the Purpose of this project is to complete an analysis that will help Louis plan her fundraise for her play FEVER 
## Analysis and Challenges
Based on the analysis conducted, most successful campaigns for theater were launched in June and with a goal less than $1000
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis gives Louis a marge of 1 month from May until Jun to launch her campaign

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was difficult to determine the factors that make a campaign fail. The main challenge was to determine from the distribution of the data that the standard deviations are larger than the mean. Witch simply determine the failed Kickstarter campaigns have really high goals.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Most successful theater campaigns launched between May and June
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most successful campaigns had small goals. The goal was less than $1000. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
the size of the dataset: we could have less data about other categories and more for theater. Also, the time frame can be rearranged to adapt Louis's campaign.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would like to see an outcome for successful campaign based on category 'theater' and countries to have an idea of the countries that Louis should target the most.
